Dota has come to R!

(or maybe vice versa!)


## RDota2

If you know Valve's popular game Dota2 then you will be pleased to know that it has come to R. If
you don't, it might interest you to have a look at [steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/570/)
to find out what it is. As a short introduction, it is one of the most popular video games ever 
made with a huge fan base of around 13 million registered users (at the time of writing)! To make
things even most interesting, you can see that Valve has actually paid the 
[biggest prize](http://www.esportsearnings.com/tournaments) ever in e-sports. The International 
Dota2 Tournament, has paid $20.7 million to its winners in August 2016.

So, how does this relate to R? Well, apparently Valve has released an API for Dota2's data (and
we are talking about a lot of data!), which is now available through R with the release of RDota2.

The package is currently on CRAN and can be installed via:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('RDota2')
```

Valve give away a huge amount of data, which is accessible through RDota2. Every single game is 
recorded and data is available for free through the package. RDota2 gives you access to the 
following API methods:

Dota 2 methods relating to match information:

* GetLeagueListing    
  Information about DotaTV-supported leagues.
* GetLiveLeagueGames    
  A list of in-progress league matches, as well as details of that match as it unfolds.
* GetMatchDetails    
  Information about a particular match.
* GetMatchHistory    
  A list of matches, filterable by various parameters.
* GetMatchHistoryBySequenceNum     
  A list of matches ordered by their sequence num.
* GetScheduledLeagueGames     
  A list of scheduled league games coming up.
* GetTeamInfoByTeamID     
  A list of all the teams set up in-game.
* GetTournamentPlayerStats     
  Stats about a particular player within a tournament.
* GetTopLiveGame     

Dota 2 methods relating to Dota 2 economy:

* GetGameItems     
  Dota 2 In-game items
* GetItemIconPath     
* GetHeroes     
  A list of heroes within Dota 2.
* GetRarities     
  Dota 2 item rarity list.
* GetTournamentPrizePool      
  The current prizepool for specific tournaments.
* GetEventStatsForAccount     

You can access the Steam API Documentation from [this link](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/WebAPI).

RDota2 provides the above methods with the use of the corresponding `get_*` functions:

## Setting up RDota2

In order to start using the package you would need a steam api key, which you can get from the
[steam community](https://steamcommunity.com/login/home/?goto=%2Fdev%2Fapikey). You will also need
a steam account. 

Once you have a key you can provide it to `key_actions`, which will make it available to all RDota2
functions so that you won't have to re-enter it every time you use an API method.

## Example of using RDota2

Let's see how we would use RDota2!

After we have installed the package, we load it with `library` and use `key actions` to register a 
key:

```{R}
#load RDota2
library(RDota2)

#register key
key_actions(action = 'register_key', value = Sys.getenv('RDota_KEY'))
```

The `value` argument requires the key we received from Steam Community. Although we could just stick
the actually key value there (it is just a combination of numbers and letters), best practice 
dictates we save it in an environmental variable, which we can then call with `Sys.getenv` as I did
above. There is a step by step explanation on how to create a system variable on the RDota2 [tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RDota2/vignettes/RDota2.html).

Now that we have registered a key we can call each one of the API methods, seen above. I will show
you some examples below:

The most useful (probably) function would be `get_match_details` which allows us to retrieve details
of a particular match.

```{R}
#match list contains information about both players and the match
match_details <- get_match_details(match_id = 2686721815)$content

#match_details[[1]] is a list with all the players - usually 10
#match_details[[1]][[1]] is just one of the 10 players
str(match_details[[1]][[1]])
```

This gives you an idea of the vast amount of information you can get for just **one** match!
As you can see you have full details for each one of the players participating (usually ten), 
including items, kills, deaths, assists, gold, experience last hits and so much more. You also get
information about the specific match!

Another important function shows us the current live league games:

```{R}
#information returned about just the first game
str(get_live_league_games()$content$games[[1]])
```

And then we have functions that show all Dota2 Heroes and all Dota2 Items:

```{R}
#items
head(get_game_items()$content, 10)

#heroes
head(get_heroes()$content, 10)
```


This is a first taste of the functions that can be used to access the Steam API. If you want 
details about every single function you can follow the [RDota2 tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RDota2/vignettes/RDota2.html). The vast amount
of data that is offered on the API can be used for data science analysis on many occassions.
For example, we could predict the winning team based on hero combinations or players' past 
performances using machine learning. But I will leave that for another post!

The code for the full package is hosted on [github](https://github.com/LyzandeR/RDota2).
